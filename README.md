# CS506-TEMPLATE-base-repo
If your project has multiple teams add changes (code, deliverables, data, etc.) to your team folder.

Create a new branch from your team branch (ex. branch name: sp23-team-1, sp23-team-2,...etc.), add changes to your team folder (on the new branch you just created).

Open a Pull Request to your team branch (ex. branch name: sp23-team-1). Add your PM and TE as reviewers. Do not delete any team folders.

At the end of the semester during project wrap up open a final Pull Request to dev from your team branch.
