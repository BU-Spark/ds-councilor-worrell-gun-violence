## Project Description <br>
Councilor Worrell, a Boston City Councilman for District 4, seeks to understand Gun Violence in the community first focusing on District 4 and then the city as a whole and its impact. There has been an uptick in gun possession amongst the youth which is concerning. This project seeks to understand what variables may be associated with increases or decreases in (police presence, poverty, population movements, etc) and look at existing programs meant to help or curb such a thing. Ultimately the project goal is to determine what drivers of violence looks like in District 4 as compared to other areas, but as a foundation, we need to understand the comparative volume and geographic distribution of gun violence in the district and beyond. The results of this analysis will hopefully inform policies that can be beneficial for improving the district. 

## Team's Approach to the Project <br> 
Our team's approach to the project was first exploring each dataset made available to us. These include police and city council district map data, police records of violence/firearm activity including shots fired, shootings, crime incident reports, and field interrogation and observations. Additionally, we looked into discipline records froms public and private Boston schools. <br>
Next, with our findings, we investigated further datasets and came up with our project extension as we were interested in academic performance across public and private Boston schools, green spaces such as parks and recreation, and community centers/programs. <br>
Finally, we tried to find correlated features to better understand the cause for the widespread gun violence in District 4.

## How to Navigate the Different Files in Repository <br> 
The repository contains a multitude of files. These include:
* html files, which represents mappings of the city of Boston along with a feature that is marked. This can be viewed on a browser.
* Jupyter Notebook files, which is where our code is stored.
* PDF files, for our deliverable reports.

## Information for Future Users to Get the Code Running <br> 
As of Deliverable 1,2,3,4 all the relevant code is stored under respective deliverable folders. <br>

Simply run the notebook to see what has been done and to continue further progress.
