## Project Summary
This project aims to The goal of this project is to understand the drivers of gun violence in Boston's District 4 and compare it to the rest of the city. The project aims to determine the rate of gun violence in the district, identify patterns in terms of location and type of violence, and analyze existing programs meant to curb violence. The results of this analysis will inform policies that can be beneficial for improving the district.

The project was completed by team-4 composed of Snigdha Reddy Pulim, Patrick Wright, Tarek Mourad, Vaishnavi Vadlamudi.

In addition to the aforementioned, our project is committed to broadening its scope by incorporating Environmental/Community Factors. We will specifically focus on factors such as Green Space, Tree Canopy, Community Programming, Interactions, and Pedestrian/Mobility data. By incorporating these additional factors, our project aims to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the community's environmental health and well-being, as well as its impact on mobility and access to public transit. This expansion will enhance our project's insights and contribute to urban planning and community development recommendations.
